# Fibonacci Invariants

Recall the definition of the Fibonacci series: the first number is 0, the second
1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two numbers preceding it.
Implement a function that computes the Fibonacci numbers recursively, storing
the results in an array.

For example, the return value of `fib(7)` is the following array:

| index |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value |  0  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  5  |  8  |  13 |

Add your code in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided some basic
testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

## Invariant

What is a good invariant for your recursive implementation of `fib()`
i.e. something that is always true at the beginning of the recursive call?

Hint: Think about what the "state of the world" is here and what you can say
about it at the start of each recursive call. Your invariant must say something
about the current recursive call.

# Answer

The Invariant which I found for my algorithm is that the fibbonachi array always has the previous two fibbonachi numbers it needs in order to get the next item in the sequence.
